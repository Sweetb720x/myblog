                    <h3 class="title">Deep fakes</h3>
                    <p class="text">Much has been said in recent years about deepfake and this term may even be associated with the wrong contexts. The deepfake is an adulterated video in which the features of a person are modified, generally the facial features, and although in principle it is entertaining to use this type of technology, the possibility of using it to blackmail people is not ruled out.</p>
                    <p class="text">Technological advances have made it easier for us to interact with deepfakes, being able to do it even from our smartphone with applications that include special filters, a very famous one is the time machine filter that applies facial features of an older person adapted to our face. There are many types of deepfakes, some more impressive than others.</p>
                    <p class="text">In 2014, the generation of images with a GAN (Generative Adverse Neural Networks) approach was developed for the first time. In the project, two neural networks were trained with the same image database to subsequently create new ones. He pitted the two networks against each other to identify which images were real and which were fictional like a digital game of cat and mouse. The first neural network model generated new images from the database it had learned by creating, say, a cat with two tails. The second model detected the dummy images and thus the first model learned from its own mistakes and generated cats with only one tail. Little by little, increasingly realistic and difficult to distinguish images were created.</p>

                    <h4 class="title">Scam case</h4>
                    <p class="text">The highly credible impersonation via deep audio fake of the voice of the CEO of a UK energy company, asking a CEO to transfer <strong class="money">€200,000</strong> to an alleged Hungarian supplier, was very popular. When the scam was discovered, the money was already spread around the world and had moved through accounts in Hungary and Mexico.</p>
                    <h4 class="title">Benefits</h4>
                    <p class="text">The legitimate use of this technology opens doors for many people and facilitates their integration into their society. People who have suffered an accident and do not feel comfortable showing their physique or simply someone who needs to know how a new haircut would look before going to the salon are great candidates to take advantage of the benefits of this technology. These and other cases are the ones that could be a boost in digital marketing, cinema, television, etc.</p>

                    <h4 class="title">The Future of Deepfakes</h4>
                    <p class="text">Without a doubt, the artificial intelligence technology behind deep fakes and machine learning has a present that is already very promising. As deep learning techniques and neural networks advance, the range of possibilities will grow rapidly in different fields such as health, education or business.</p>
                    <p class="text">However, as access to this technology advances and increases, so does the risk of using deepfakes for malicious purposes. Artificial intelligence itself can be used to detect deep fakes. Some companies like Google have released a database with thousands of manipulated videos to develop tools to detect fakes. This game of cat and mouse to create counterfeits and detect them in the background is accelerating innovation in this field, which must be in the service of positive use.</p>
                    <h4 class="title">In order to conclude</h4>
                    <p class="text">Simulation's bad reputation, however, should not overshadow its potential: the testing of simulated drugs in simulated organs, affected by simulated diseases; subatomic experimentation for the development of alternative energies; the algorithmic projection of space travel; industrial, agri-food and even artistic applications. Most of these disciplines require immense computational power (and in this field the biggest bet is quantum computing), but what is interesting is the underlying premise. Goodfellow wants networks to "understand the world based on a hierarchy of concepts, each defined from simpler concepts" derived from experience.</p>
                    <p class="text">If artificial intelligence neural networks continue at this rate of acceleration, humanity will have at its disposal tools capable of dislocating its experience with the world. Always. Unlike other technologies, “democratization” will not solve the dilemmas that deepfakes present. From whom shall we demand the truth? We may have to get used to living without it.</p>
